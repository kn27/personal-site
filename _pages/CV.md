My name is Khanh-Tung Nguyen-Ba, before giving up you can call me Keane (yup I picked that English name from the most mellow British alternative [rock band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVe_KVzBFOo)). After 6 years working in consulting and fintech, I am currently on sabbatical to recharge and look for the next challenge.

Born and raised in Vietnam, I get excited about the recent development in South East Asia and plan to come back soon. In the meantime, you can find me sweating at [Five Point Academy](https://www.academyfivepoints.com/) or learning to surf at Rockaway Beach (look for the dude with an inflatable surfboard).

Let's grab a coffee if you want to chat about tech and developing countries.
